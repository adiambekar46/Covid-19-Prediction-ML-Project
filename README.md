Predicting the Disease will help to prevent infection and early treatment. From this data, creating model from it with high accuracy would help in predicting weather the person can get infected with covid or not. This model will predict weather patient is Covid infected or not by statistically calculating correlation between the patients symptoms like Cough symptoms, Fever, Sore throat, Shortness of breath, Headache and covid test result. The test result could take time for results, but with the help of this model if patient data have valid symptoms we could predict if that person have Covid or not. Hence the treatement would begin much faster and if the person is still not infected we could prevent it earlier.
